I'll describe each file's role and how they integrate together:
createSurvey.ts:
Purpose: Factory function to create a new survey instance
Key Features:
Creates the survey definition structure
Generates a React component wrapper
Handles initial metadata setup
Integration Points:
Uses useSurveyRunner for submission handling
Returns a reusable Survey component
Connects with the Survey component from Survey.tsx
2. useSurvey.ts:
Purpose: Core form state management hook
Key Features:
Manages form values and errors
Handles validation
Tracks overall form validity
Integration Points:
Used by the Survey component
Provides form state management
Handles per-question validation
3. useSurveyRunner.ts:
Purpose: Survey progress and submission management hook
Key Features:
Wraps the SurveyRunner class functionality
Provides React-friendly interface
Handles cleanup on unmount
Integration Points:
Used by components created by createSurvey
Connects to SurveyRunner class
Manages survey lifecycle
The flow between these components:
createSurvey creates a new survey definition and component
The created component uses useSurveyRunner for progress/submission
The Survey component uses useSurvey for form state
useSurveyRunner connects to SurveyRunner for persistence/progress
Key Differences:
useSurvey: Focuses on form state and validation
useSurveyRunner: Handles survey progress and submission
createSurvey: Factory for creating survey instances
SurveyRunner: Core class for survey lifecycle management
This separation of concerns allows:
Independent form state management
Separate progress tracking
Clean component creation
Reusable survey instances
